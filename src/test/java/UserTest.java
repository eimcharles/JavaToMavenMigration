/**
 *          UserTest: Unit Test Class
 *          Purpose: This class is responsible for testing the functionality of the
 *          'User.java' production class (which should reside in src/main/java/com/eimc).
 *
 *          Naming Convention:
 *          - The name 'UserTest' adheres to the standard Maven/JUnit convention (ProductionClassName + Test).
 *          - Maven's build system (specifically the maven-surefire-plugin) automatically
 *            discovers and executes all classes ending in 'Test.java' during the 'mvn test' goal.
 *
 *          Location:
 *          - This file must be located in the src/test/java directory structure
 *          (e.g., src/test/java/com/eimc/UserTest.java) to be processed by Maven.
